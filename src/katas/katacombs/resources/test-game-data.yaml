  # Room and Connection descriptions

  ## Nowhere
  room-nowhere: >-
    You’re on the road to Nowhere

  ## Start
  room-start: >-
    You are standing at the end of a brick lane before a small brick building called 
    "The Old Truman Brewery". 
    Around you is a forest of restaurants and bars. A small stream of crafted beer flows out of
    the building and down a gully.
  room-start-short: You're in front of the brewery

  connection-start-north: >-
    I see a brick building with a sign saying “Truman Brewery“.    

  ## Building
  room-building: You are inside the main room of the Truman Brewery.
  room-building-short: You’re inside the brewery

  ## Square
  room-square: >-
    The square buzzes with life, its cobblestones echoing footsteps and laughter. 
    To the west, a lively bar beckons; to the east, a quaint shop glows under hanging lanterns. 
    To the south, an alley disappears into shadow, while the Old Truman Brewery stands tall to the north.
  room-square-short: You're at the Cobblestone Square.

  connection-square-east: >-
    The shop is a snug little building with a painted sign above the door that reads Dig & Flame Emporium. 
    Its simple façade is offset by the warm glow of lanterns hanging on either side. 

  ## Shop
  room-shop: >-
    You are in a shop, a snug little space with barely more than a counter and a few items on 
    display. A lighter and a sturdy shovel sit prominently, their utility clear.
  room-shop-short: You're inside the shop.

  # NPC texts

  # Shopkeeper
  shopkeeper-description-room: >-
    The shopkeeper stands behind the counter, humming a tune with a rich Caribbean lilt. 
    His bright shirt and straw hat match his warm, inviting smile.
  shopkeeper-description-look: >-
    The shopkeeper’s sun-kissed skin and twinkling eyes exude charm. 
    His voice flows like a tropical breeze, and his calloused hands hint at a life of labor.
  npc-shopkeeper-welcome: >-
    Welcome, traveler, to Dig & Flame Emporium! Don’t let the name fool you — I only sell two 
    items. But they’re the best two items you’ll ever find!
  npc-shopkeeper-only-two-items: >-
    Ah, a fine question! Well, it all started when the Great Item Shortage swept through this town. 
    Bandits looted my stock, a cursed storm destroyed my warehouse, and my last supplier ran off 
    to join a traveling circus. All I could salvage was this shovel and this lighter. And by the stars, I intend to make them famous!
  npc-shopkeeper-lighter-description: >-
    Ah, the lighter! Compact, reliable, and stylish. It’s the Torch of Eternity™. 
    Legend has it, it can ignite any fire — even in the rain! Adventurers love it. Plus, it’s 
    perfect for campfires, lanterns, or sending ominous smoke signals to your enemies. A bargain at just 10 coins!"
  npc-shopkeeper-shovel-description: >-
    Oh, this isn’t just any shovel. It’s the Gold-Digger Supreme™! Forged by master blacksmiths and enchanted by the 
    Hermit of Hillside. It can dig through anything — stone, sand, even your regrets. Perfect for 
    treasure hunters or anyone who needs to bury some… secrets. Yours for only 100 coins!
  npc-shopkeeper-rumor-treasure-island: >-
    Ah, Treasure Island… the stuff of legends! They say it’s a paradise of gold and gems beyond imagination. 
    But finding it? That’s another story. Few ever do, and fewer still come back alive.
  npc-shopkeeper-no-adventurer: >-
    Me? Oh, I’m no adventurer! No, no. I prefer staying right here, where it’s safe. 
    Though I did have a customer once — a scrappy young sailor. Swore up and down he had the key to Treasure Island. 
    Poor lad disappeared soon after. Left behind a crumpled map and an empty bottle of grog.
  npc-shopkeeper-sailor: >-
    Vanished without a trace. Some say he found the island and chose to stay. Others say the island… took him. 
    And then there’s the skeptics who think he drank one bottle too many and fell into the sea. 
    Either way, his tale is all I’ve got left to tell. That, and this lighter. Speaking of which… still 10 coins!
  npc-shopkeeper-yoho: >-
    Ah, ‘yoho,’ you say? You’ll find that’s a word known by many a sailor… but few understand its power. 
    It’s not just for singing sea shanties, I assure you. That word... it can take you places. 
    But don’t just speak it anywhere. Wait for the right moment, and it’ll work wonders.
  npc-shopkeeper-what-will-it-be: >-
    Excellent choice! Now, will it be the Gold-Digger Supreme™ for 100 coins, or the Torch of Eternity™ for 10 coins? 
    Don’t let indecision burn a hole in your pocket!
  npc-shopkeeper-bye: >-
    Well, it’s been a pleasure, truly. If you find yourself with more coins — or in need of wisdom beyond your means — 
    you know where to find me.
  npc-shopkeeper-serious: >-
    Serious as a dragon’s roar, my friend! This isn’t some common gardener’s tool; it’s an investment! Besides, 
    with treasure-hunting season in full swing, every digger in town wants one. You don’t want to be the only one 
    without a shovel, do you?"
  npc-shopkeeper-suit-yourself: >-
    Suit yourself, wanderer, but remember this: opportunities, like lighters, are hard to come by. 
    Don’t dig yourself into a hole without the right tools!
  npc-shopkeeper-10-coins: >-
    Splendid choice! That’ll be 10 coins.
  npc-shopkeeper-100-coins: >-
    Splendid choice! That’ll be 100 coins.
  npc-shopkeeper-sells-lighter: >-
    Ah, a sound investment, my friend! Here’s your Torch of Eternity™. 
    Careful now—it’s not just a lighter; it’s a spark for adventure!
  npc-shopkeeper-sells-shovel: >-
    Pleasure doing business with you! Remember, if you dig up something valuable, don’t forget your old pal here 
    at the shop, eh? Now off you go! — dig up a fortune or two!
  npc-shopkeeper-short-on-coins-10: >-
    Oh dear… looks like your purse is feeling a little light. No flame for you until you come back with 10 coins. 
    Unless you’ve got something shiny to barter? No? Well, no hard feelings, traveler. 
    Times are tough for all of us, eh?
  npc-shopkeeper-short-on-coins-100: >-
    A shovel, eh? Fine taste you’ve got there! But... let’s see... oh dear, seems you’re a bit short on coins. 
    Only got enough for a handful of dirt at this rate! Come back when you’ve struck it rich, yeah?

  # Item and action descriptions

  ## Cheese
  item-cheese-inventory: A wedge of fine cheddar
  item-cheese-room: You see a wedge of cheese with a golden hue and a rich aroma, filling the air with savory promise.
  item-cheese-look: It's a piece of cheddar. It has a crumbly texture with glinting crystals, exuding a mature, sharp scent that teases your senses."

  eat-cheese: >-
    As you lift the cheese to your lips, a thought skitters through your mind:
    better save this savory delight for a moment of true need.
  drop-cheese-success: >-
    The rat sniffs the air, its nose twitching like mad. With lightning speed, 
    it grabs the cheese and scurries into the hole, leaving you in the quiet triumph 
    of rodent-free solitude.
  drop-cheese-failure: >-
    As you reach into your inventory to drop the cheese, your hand comes up empty. 
    It seems the cheese has taken its own path to freedom.


  ## Gully
  look-gully-success: >-
    You peer into the gully. Amid the shimmering stream of crafted beer, two coins glint invitingly. 
    Seems like someone’s loss might be your gain.
  look-gully-failure: >-
    You look into the gully again. It’s just beer and pebbles now—no more free treasure for you.

  ## Casks
  item-casks-room: There is a strong smell of hops and a dozen empty casks.
  look-casks-success: >-
    You peer closely at the casks. Amidst the dust and cobwebs, 
    a glint catches your eye — a single coin nestled against the wood. 
    A hidden treasure or someone’s forgotten tip?
  look-casks-failure: >-
